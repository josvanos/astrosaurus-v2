# Astrosaurus 🦕

<img src="/astrosaurus.png" class="hero" />

Astrosaurus is a documentation & blog & simple home page tool for alternative to [Vitepress](https://github.com/) and [Docusaurus](https://github.com/).

Astrosaurus could be a perfect fit for a project that searchs a fast documentation website. As Astro itself is king in static website generation.

### Features

- #### 🚀 Astro

Astro makes Astrosaurus shine like a meteor. With their builtin markdown support, Astrosaurus is just a template and a set of tools to build your documentation, blog or fast and clean.

- #### 🖼️ Framework agnostic

we use no renderer as React, Vue or Svelte under the hood. Every interactive element of the user interface is written in plain javascript.
